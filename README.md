# Teamslack
Runs MS Teams' web app in one tab of Chromium Embedded, and Slack's web app in another.

Super-basic app I made for fun during a day off from work.  I am getting tired of how bloated the desktop Teams and Slack clients have become (especially when running both simultaneously!!)


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
-------
Build with Windows with Xojo 2022 r3.1


INFORMATION
-------
Teamslack not meant for production use (obviously)

Xojo's DesktopHTMLViewer is implemented differently on macOS and Linux than it is on Windows, so no support for those platforms :(
